#+tags[]: REU python

In the summer of 2019 I was lucky enough to be accepted into the University of
Arizona's [[http://catvehicle.arizona.edu/verification-and-creation-autonomous-vehicle-trajectories-non-experts-reactive-design-time-feedback][CATVehicle]] REU. Over the course of 10 weeks my group mates and I
developed a Domain Specific Modeling Language (DSML) aimed at providing a simple
interface for 4th grade students to interact with an autonomous vehicle. This
language was used to augment a robotics curriculum for over 420 students in the
Tucson area. Below you can see the video that I produced explaining the project
and my part in it:
