* Constellations
This is animation is based on the animation found [[http://slicker.me/javascript/particles.htm][here]]. However, I wrote this
program as an excuse to try out TypeScript so I made it object oriented instead
of trying to do it in as few lines as possible. Check it out on [[https://github.com/AlexanderDavid/ConstellationAnimation][GitHub]].

* Collatz Conjecture Visualized
This is my take on the Coding Train's Coding in the [[https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingInTheCabana/002-collatz-conjecture.html][Cabana Collatz Conjecture]].
My version is using Python and the Python P5 library. The basis of the code is
that it generates each Collatz series from 10 to 10,000, reverses them, and then
draws each series as a line that goes left if the current number is odd and
right if it is even. This leads to some interesting patterns. The code is on my
[[https://github.com/AlexanderDavid/Collatz-Conjecture-Visualization][my GitHub]], and a gif showing the animation is below.
