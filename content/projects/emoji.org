#+description: A new algorithm to translate sentences into multiple emojis

For my senior year capstone project at Clarion University I worked with another
student to try and summarize sentences by producing a string of emojis. We
accomplished this goal through the use of vector embeddings. Both the [[/posts/naive-emoji-summarization/][initial]]
and [[/posts/dependency-tree-collapse/][final]] algorithms are explained in blog posts, as well as a [[/posts/dependency-tree-collapse/][novel sentence segmentation algorithm]]
that was developed as a consequence of the project. We
presented this project at the Penn York conference([[/ppt/PennYorkSentenceCompression.pptx][slides]], [[/pdf/PennYorkAbstact.pdf][abstract]]) in Clarion
and published a [[/pdf/emoji.pdf][paper]] at the 2020 PACISE conference.
