#+description: Bankers algorithm implemented online in Python

Banker's Algorithm implemented in Python3 with a Flask RESTful backend and
HTML/Bootstrap/JS front end. The site is hosted on Heroku at
[[https://bankers.alexday.me]].

* Usage
This was a project for the Operating Systems class at Clarion. This project had
a specific input file format that is shown on the left hand side of the web app.
This format is also shown with comments describing what each line corresponds to
below.

#+BEGIN_SRC c
5       // Number of processes
3       // Number of resources
10 5 7  // Maximum resource allocation
0 1 0   // Currently allocated for proc 1
2 0 0   // Currently allocated for proc 2
3 0 2   // Currently allocated for proc 3
2 1 1   // Currently allocated for proc 4
0 0 2   // Currently allocated for proc 5
7 5 3   // Max allocated for proc 1
3 2 2   // Max allocated for proc 2
9 0 2   // Max allocated for proc 3
2 2 2   // Max allocated for proc 4
4 3 3   // Max allocated for proc 5
#+END_SRC

This is the default configuration used on the first launch of the application.
The right hand side is used to make resource requests and also to check the
validity of the current system configuration. Seen below is a screenshot of the
bankers algorithm interface.
