#+description: An overview of the config files and programs I use to access email in emacs

Email management, when heavily abstracted, is simple. To start reading
email offline on your own PC you need three programs:
- Sync email to/from IMAP server (~OfflineIMAP~)
- Manage email on your PC (~mu~ and ~mu4e~)
- Send email (~msmtp~)
Once these three parts are working together then email can be downloaded,
viewed, and replied to. Getting these programs working is no easy task, however.

My motivation in doing this was the end goal of easily ~org capture~-ing my
emails and adding them to my master ~todo.org~ file. I thought that by keeping
all of my actionable tasks in one central place I could be more productive. Time
will tell if that assumption is true.

* OfflineIMAP
~OfflineIMAP~ is a tool written in python to facilitate the downloading and
uploading of mail from an IMAP server. There are other programs for doing this
(namely, [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Isync][~mbsync~]]), but I chose ~OfflineIMAP~ because it was the easiest for me
to setup, didn't have any weird certificate errors with gmail, and I could
extend it easily with python.

My ~OfflineIMAP~ setup uses two gmail accounts. However, for the sake of
brevity, I have trimmed it down to just use one. The whole
configuration is in my [[https://github.com/AlexanderDavid/dotfiles][dotfiles]] repository.

To store passwords on the command line I use the [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pass][~pass~]] password manager.
To access the passwords from ~OfflineIMAP~ I included the following function in
the main configuration so I could just call the function to get the passwords
for my account. One thing to note is that if you have 2fa enabled on a Gmail
account you will need to use an [[https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en][app password]] to login with ~OfflineIMAP~.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
# ~/.config/offlineimap/pass.py
#! /usr/bin/env python3
from subprocess import check_output

def get_pass(account):
        return check_output("pass mail/" + account, shell=True).splitlines()[0]
#+END_SRC

I dislike the ~[Gmail].~ prefix that ~OfflineIMAP~ downloads the folders from
the server with by default. To solve this I use a python lambda function to both
remove the prefix and rename the ~Sent Mail~ to just ~Sent~ to make my folder
structure cleaner.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
# ~/.config/offlineimap/config:22
nametrans = lambda f: f.replace('[Gmail]/', '').replace("Sent Mail", "Sent") \
                      if f.startswith('[Gmail]/') else f
#+END_SRC

On top of renaming some folders I also disabled some of the folders I don't use
in Gmail's settings. You can do this by going to ~settings~ \rightarrow ~Labels~.

All in all my ~OfflineIMAP~ config file is simple. If you are looking for a more
verbose version you can find one at ~/usr/share/offlineimap/offlineimap.conf~
once ~OfflineIMAP~ is installed.
#+BEGIN_SRC toml
# ~/.config/offlineimap/config
[general]
ui = ttyui
accounts = Clemson
# Include python password function
pythonfile = ~/.config/offlineimap/pass.py

[Account Clemson]
localrepository = Clemson-Local
remoterepository = Clemson-Remote

[Repository Clemson-Local]
type = Maildir
localfolders = ~/.local/share/mail/clemson

[Repository Clemson-Remote]
type = Gmail
remoteuser = adday@g.clemson.edu
remotepasseval = get_pass("clemson")
realdelete = no
maxconnections = 5
sslcacertfile = /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
nametrans = lambda f: f.replace('[Gmail]/', '').replace("Sent Mail", "Sent") if f.startswith('[Gmail]/') else f
#+END_SRC


One of the only problems I have with ~OfflineIMAP~ is its' speed. To do the
initial download of the 130,000-odd
emails I have in my main Gmail account it took around 4 hours. However, after
this initial sync the time required went down to about a 40 seconds for two
accounts. 

Once you have ~OfflineIMAP~ set up you can run ~offlineimap~ to sync everything,
supply the ~-a~ flag with a specific account to just sync that account.
* mu/mu4e
~mu~ is a super fast mail indexer that comes with ~mu4e~ which is an email
client for emacs. Both of them work together to allow a powerful, search based
email interface that is keyboard-driven. When you first start it up you will see
a relatively bare main menu.

{{< image src="/img/mu4e-main-menu.png" alt="mu4e main menu" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

From there you can jump to your inbox and start reading and replying to mail.
There are videos that can explain ~mu4e~ a lot better than I can so if you need
an intro I would recommend [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=newRHXKm4H4][Mike Zamansky's mu4e video]].

I use [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][doom emacs]] and I haven't tested this config in vanilla emacs so I cannot
guarentee that this will work but I can see no reason why it wouldnt. Basicelly
this config sets up a mail account with specific folders for the mail. It also
sets up ~msmtp~ as the mechanism to send a message.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; ~/.doom.d/config.el
(require 'mu4e)

;; use mu4e for e-mail in emacs
(setq mail-user-agent 'mu4e-user-agent)
(setq mu4e-maildir "/home/alex/.local/share/mail")

;; default
(setq mu4e-contexts
    `( ,(make-mu4e-context
        :name "clemson"
        :enter-func (lambda ()
                        (mu4e-message "Entering Clemson context")
                        ;; Quicky jump to/move a mail to different folders
                        (setq mu4e-maildir-shortcuts  '( ("/clemson/INBOX"   . ?i)
                                                         ("/clemson/Sent"    . ?s)
                                                         ("/clemson/Trash"   . ?t)
                                                         ("/clemson/All Mail". ?a)
                                                         ("/clemson/archive" . ?r))))
        :leave-func (lambda ()
                        (mu4e-message "Leaving Clemson context"))
        :match-func (lambda (msg)
                        (when msg
                            ;; Clemson has two valid emails for each student
                            (or (mu4e-message-contact-field-matches msg
                                    :to "adday@clemson.edu")
                                (mu4e-message-contact-field-matches msg
                                    :to "adday@g.clemson.edu"))))

        :vars '( ( user-mail-address      . "adday@clemson.edu"  )
                 ( user-full-name         . "Alex Day" )
                 ( mu4e-drafts-folder     . "/clemson/Drafts")
                 ( mu4e-sent-folder       . "/clemson/Sent")
                 ( mu4e-trash-folder      . "/clemson/Trash")
                 ( mu4e-refile-folder     . "/clemson/archive" )
                 ( mu4e-compose-signature . (concat "Alex Day"))))))


;; don't save message to Sent Messages, Gmail/IMAP takes care of this
(setq mu4e-sent-messages-behavior 'delete)

;; allow for updating mail using 'U' in the main view:
(setq mu4e-get-mail-command "offlineimap")

(setq message-send-mail-function 'message-send-mail-with-sendmail)
(setq sendmail-program "/usr/bin/msmtp")
;; tell msmtp to choose the SMTP server by the 'from' field in the outgoing email
(setq message-sendmail-extra-arguments '("--read-envelope-from"))
(setq message-sendmail-f-is-evil 't)
#+END_SRC

As well as just reading messages in emacs I also wanted some way of capturing
messages with org-capture. To do this I set up a capture template that I could
use while either in a message or hovering over a message on the ~mu4e~ search.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'org-mu4e)
(setq org-capture-templates
        ("e" "Email Todo" entry (file+headline "~/doc/org/todo.org" "Inbox")
         "* TODO %?\nProcess mail from %:fromname on %:subject\nSCHEDULED:%t\nDEADLINE: %(org-insert-time-stamp (org-read-date nil t \"+2d\"))\n:PROPERTIES:\n:CREATED: %U\n:END:\n %a" :prepend t))
#+END_SRC
* msmtp
I use ~msmtp~ to send emails from ~mu4e~. It handles multiple email addresses by
reading the 'from' field that ~mu4e~ sends along with the email. This program is
the only one I have had absolutely no problems with.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
# ~/.config/msmtp/config
defaults
auth on
tls on
tls_trust_file /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
logfile ~/.config/msmtp/msmtp.log

account clemson
host smtp.gmail.com
port 587
from adday@clemson.edu
user adday@g.clemson.edu
passwordeval "pass mail/clemson"

account default : clemson
#+END_SRC
* Show Unread Mail in the Statusbar
I use this script to display the number of unread emails in my status bar. I use
[[https://tools.suckless.org/slstatus/][slstatus]] with the [[https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/status2d/][status2d]] patch for [[https://dwm.suckless.org/][dwm]] to allow colors in the status bar. It
should be plug and play if you change the directory it looks for new mail in and
have font-awesome installed for the mailbox icon.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
#!/usr/bin/env sh

# Get the number of new mails in all INBOX folders
NEWMAILS=$(du -a ~/.local/share/mail/*/INBOX/new/* 2>/dev/null | wc -l)

# Print the number of new mails to the statusbar if there are any
if [ "$NEWMAILS" -gt 0 ]; then
    printf "^b%s^" $(xgetres slstatus.color2)
    printf "^c%s^" $(xgetres slstatus.background)
    printf " ï¯¬ %s" $NEWMAILS
else
    # If there are no new mails then print a block the same color
    # as the background. This is because slstatus will show the previous
    # color if it is not overwriten
    printf "^c%s^^b%s^placeholder^d^" $(xgetres slstatus.background) $(xgetres slstatus.background)
fi
#+END_SRC
* Conclusions
I have been reading and writing emails this way for the past couple of weeks and
I could be happier. Namely I haven't really researched how to attach files to
email and when sending emails back and forth from two accounts that ~mu4e~ is
tracking it can get a little confusing. Apart from that, however, I am
satisfied with the workflow that these config files set up.
