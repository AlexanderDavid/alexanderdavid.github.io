My name is Alex Day. I have a B.S. in computer science from [[https://clarion.edu][Clarion University]]
and I am currently planning on attending [[https://clemson.edu][Clemson University]] in the Fall of 2020
for a Ph.D. in computer science with a focus on robotics. In the past I have
involved myself in Natural Language Processing research at Clarion and
Autonomous Vehicle research at the University of Arizona. In my free time I
enjoy grappling and long walks on the beach. If you want a more formal
introduction you can check out my [[/pdf/AlexDayCV.pdf][CV]] or [[/pdf/AlexDayResume.pdf][resume]]. This website will
hopefully serve as a place to keep my ramblings and accomplishments.
