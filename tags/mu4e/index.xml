Recently I have been trying to combine the two and capture tasks that link to emails. I wanted to tag my capture items based on the inbox they fall into, :@home: for my personal and :@school for my school emails. I cobbled together this function based upon different stackexchange posts and figured I would share it here for anyone who wanted to do the same.</description></item><item><title>Emacs for Email</title><link>/posts/emacs-for-email/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/emacs-for-email/</guid><description>Email management, when heavily abstracted, is simple.

Getting these programs working is no easy task, however.</description></item></channel></rss>
