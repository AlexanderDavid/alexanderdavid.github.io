We accomplished this goal through the use of vector embeddings. The initial algorithm is explained in a blog posts, as well as a novel sentence segmentation algorithm that I developed as a consequence of the project. We presented this project at the Penn York conference(slides, abstract) in Clarion and published a paper at the 2020 PACISE conference.</description></item><item><title>Dependency Tree Collapse for N-Gram Generation</title><link>https://www.alexday.me/posts/dependency-tree-collapse/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.alexday.me/posts/dependency-tree-collapse/</guid><description>Introduction Throughout the past semester I have been working on my senior capstone project for my CS undergraduate. The project is to create Emoji summaries for sentences and one of the integral parts of this algorithm is separating a sentence into a sequence of n-grams that represent it. In the initial algorithm, I took a naive approach of generating every single combination of n-grams, summarizing them all, and then returning the summary with the highest result.</description></item><item><title>Naive Sentence to Emoji Translation</title><link>https://www.alexday.me/posts/naive-emoji-summarization/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.alexday.me/posts/naive-emoji-summarization/</guid><description>Motivation My senior capstone project for my computer science degree is research focused on summarizing sentences. My group mate and I decided to try and accomplish this by converting sentences into Emoji. We think that this will produce a more information-dense string. This problem is rather similar to a plethora of different problems in computer science and other, unrelated, domains. Within computer science, it is adjacent to the Emoji prediction and Emoji embedding problems.</description></item></channel></rss>
