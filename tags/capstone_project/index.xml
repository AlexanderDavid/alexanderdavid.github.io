The project is to create Emoji summaries for sentences and one of the integral parts of this algorithm is separating a sentence into a sequence of n-grams that represent it. In the initial algorithm, I took a naive approach of generating every single combination of n-grams, summarizing them all, and then returning the summary with the highest result.</description></item><item><title>Naive Sentence to Emoji Translation</title><link>www.alexday.me/posts/naive-emoji-summarization/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>www.alexday.me/posts/naive-emoji-summarization/</guid><description>Motivation My senior capstone project for my computer science degree is research focused on summarizing sentences. My group mate and I decided to try and accomplish this by converting sentences into Emoji. We think that this will produce a more information-dense string. This problem is rather similar to a plethora of different problems in computer science and other, unrelated, domains. Within computer science, it is adjacent to the Emoji prediction and Emoji embedding problems.</description></item></channel></rss>
