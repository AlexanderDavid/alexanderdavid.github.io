Recently I have been trying to combine the two and capture tasks that link to emails. I wanted to tag my capture items based on the inbox they fall into, :@home: for my personal and :@school for my school emails. I cobbled together this function based upon different stackexchange posts and figured I would share it here for anyone who wanted to do the same.</description></item><item><title>Python Docstring</title><link>https://www.alexday.me/projects/python-docstring/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 May 2020 17:41:26 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.alexday.me/projects/python-docstring/</guid><description>Emacs Emacs is an incredibly extensible editor. It is one of the two major players in the unix &amp;#34;poweruser&amp;#34; editor wars. It is both configured and extended in elisp, an emacs-specific dialect of lisp. The main benefit I see of using Emacs is how I can easily add functionality I find that I need.

To start reading email offline on your own PC you need three programs:
Sync email to/from IMAP server (mbsync)
Manage email on your PC (mu and mu4e)
Send email (msmtp)
Once these three parts are working together then email can be downloaded, viewed, and replied to. Getting these programs working is no easy task, however.</description></item></channel></rss>
