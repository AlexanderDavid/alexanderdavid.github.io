      <description>Introduction   Throughout the past semester I have been working on my senior capstone project for my CS undergraduate. The project is to create Emoji summaries for sentences and one of the integral parts of this algorithm is separating a sentence into a sequence of n-grams that represent it. In the initial algorithm, I took a naive approach of generating every single combination of n-grams, summarizing them all, and then returning the summary with the highest result.</description>

      <description>Motivation   My senior capstone project for my computer science degree is research focused on summarizing sentences. My group mate and I decided to try and accomplish this by converting sentences into Emoji. We think that this will produce a more information-dense string. This problem is rather similar to a plethora of different problems in computer science and other, unrelated, domains. Within computer science, it is adjacent to the Emoji prediction and Emoji embedding problems.</description>

      <description>Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (commonly abbreviated as TF-IDF) is a formula commonly used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to determine the relative importance of a word. The formula is comprised of two sub-formulas, term frequency and inverse document frequency. The basic assumption of this formula is that if a word appears more in one document and less in every other document in the corpus then it is very important to that specific document.</description>

      <description>My name is Alex Day. I have a B.S. in computer science from Clarion University and I am currently planning on attending Clemson University in the Fall of 2020 for a Ph.D. in computer science with a focus on robotics. In the past I have involved myself in Natural Language Processing research at Clarion and Autonomous Vehicle research at the University of Arizona. In my free time I enjoy grappling and long walks on the beach.</description>
